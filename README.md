## A pipeline for performing systems analyses:
![Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeper-eng/workspace/main/resources/Pipelineflic.png)

 Pictured is a directed graph describing the pipeline for our MD trajectory analysis. From left to right, we begin with a trajectory file, and convert it into a set of networks (one for each trajectory frame), which that can be represented as either graphs or adjacency matrices. Each frame adjacency is flattened into a vector by concatenating the matrix’s rows (vector reduction). The frame vectors are vertically concatenated to create a feature matrix that can be used as input to either K-means clustering or PCA, whose results can then be visualized using graphs, scatter plots, MDCcircos plots, (of residue H-bonding), or MD replicate maps of frame measurements of interest.


 We also provide an additional module for taking theese various results and using clustering results as input substates for markov state model analyses.

## Use pip install to get started:

```bash

pip install mdsa-tools

```

## Quickstart example (see examples for more use-cases;contour plots, UMAP, MSM, etc):
```python
from mdsa_tools.Data_gen_hbond import trajectory as traj
import numpy as np
import os

##########
#Datagen#
#########

#load in and test trajectory
system_one_topology = '/Users/luis/Desktop/workspace/PDBs/5JUP_N2_CGU_nowat.prmtop'
system_one_trajectory = '/Users/luis/Desktop/workspace/PDBs/CCU_CGU_10frames.mdcrd' 


system_two_topology = '/Users/luis/Desktop/workspace/PDBs/5JUP_N2_GCU_nowat.prmtop'
system_two_trajectory = '/Users/luis/Desktop/workspace/PDBs/CCU_GCU_10frames.mdcrd' 


test_trajectory_one = traj(trajectory_path=system_one_trajectory,topology_path=system_one_topology)
test_trajectory_two = traj(trajectory_path=system_two_trajectory,topology_path=system_two_topology)


#now that its loaded in try to make object
test_system_one_ = test_trajectory_one.create_system_representations()
test_system_two_ = test_trajectory_two.create_system_representations()


np.save('/Users/luis/Desktop/workspacetwo/example_systems/test_system_one',test_system_one_)
np.save('/Users/luis/Desktop/workspacetwo/example_systems/test_system_two',test_system_two_)

## Systems Problem Area:

![System panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeper-eng/workspace/main/resources/PanelA_summerposter.png)
At the Weir Lab at Wesleyan University, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a ribosomal subsystem to study tuning of protein translation by the CAR interaction surface- a ribosomal interface identified by the lab that interacts with the +1 codon (poised to enter the ribosome A site). Our "computational genetics" research focuses on modifying adjacent codon identities at the A-site and the +1 positions to model how changes at these sites influence the behavior of the CAR surface and corellate with translation rate variations.
