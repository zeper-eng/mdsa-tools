# SBTA

This was my BA/MA project which leveraged network theoretic concepts and machine learning techniques to perform a systems biology analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of a ribsomal subsystem we deemed the N2 nighborhood.

The labs current focus is on computational genetics expirements.
We modify various adjacent codon identites at the A-site and +1 (poised to enter the A site 5'-3').
