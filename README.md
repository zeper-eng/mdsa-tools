# SBTA

This was my BA/MA project which leveraged network theoretic concepts and machine learning techniques to perform a systems biology analysis of a ribsomal subsystem subsystem 
we deemed the N2 nighborhood.

The labs current focus is on the effects of Codon identity at the A-site and Incoming (poised to enter the Asite) on translation rates as well as how a ribosomal interaction
surface discovered by the lab *CAR*  might be involved in this regulation.

More updates soon as I clean up my work and produce a proper python library
