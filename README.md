Pictured is a directed graph describing the pipeline for our trajectory analysis. From left to right, we begin with a trajectory file, convert it into networks, which can be represented as either graphs or adjacency matrices. We move forward with the adjacency matrix representations and concatenate each matrixâ€™s rows to create a vector representation of our system at every frame. Next, we vertically concatenate these to create a feature matrix that can be used as input to either K-means or PCA, whose results can then be visualized using the principal components analysis, our MDcircos plots, or replicate maps (which can alternatively represent the raw H-bond counts).

The labs current focus is on computational genetics expirements.
We modify various adjacent codon identites at the A-site and +1 (poised to enter the A site 5'-3')
in order to model the varying behaviors of the CAR interaction surface and how they correllate to varying
translation rate changes.

# The easiest way to get going if your familiar with python developement especially in conda environments is to pip install after forking. I.E.:

```bash

# First fork the repository over 
git clone https://github.com/zeper-eng/workspace.git
cd workspace

#Now from inside of the workspace folder simply pip install!

pip install .

#Regardless of the python environment you should be good to go
pip show workspace
```

# This will eventually be replaced with a proper pip install but we are clearly in development
