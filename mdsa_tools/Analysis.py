'''
Mostly functions as a big wrapper for conveniently storing a lot of our analysis methods. 

Generally you can follow our pipeline but,the individual steps are pretty modular if your comfortable doing simple numpy transmutations etc.
You could for instance use the clustering on various number of n_dimensional datasets, or pull H-bond values using 
systems_analysis.extract_hbond_values() and use thoose in replicate maps instead of k-means cluster assignments.

class systems_analysis:
    '''
    Container for systems-level analyses on residue–residue adjacency matrices.

    This class assumes each “system representation” is a 3D array with shape
    ``(n_frames, n_residues, n_residues)`` where a single frame contains a
    residue×residue adjacency matrix (e.g., H-bond counts/weights). Many methods
    operate on a *feature matrix* constructed by flattening/stacking per-frame
    upper triangles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    systems_representations : list of np.ndarray
        Expected format: ``[array_1, ..., array_m]``, where each array has
        shape ``(n_frames, n_residues, n_residues)``. The only permitted
        difference across arrays is ``n_frames``; all systems should share
        the same residue dimension.
    replicate_distribution : array-like of int or None, optional
        Optional labels or indices describing how frames are distributed
        across replicates/systems. If ``None``, defaults to
        ``np.arange(0, systems_representations[0].shape[0])``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    num_systems : int
        Number of systems provided (i.e., ``len(systems_representations)``).
    systems_representations : list of np.ndarray
        Original input, retained for convenience.
    indexes : np.ndarray
        Derived from ``systems_representations[0][0, 0, 1:]``. Arrays include
        index data, introducing one extra row/column (negligible overhead for
        typical datasets).
    feature_matrix : np.ndarray or None
        Cached 2D feature matrix produced by ``replicates_to_featurematrix``.
    replicate_distribution : np.ndarray
        Distribution vector set from the provided argument or default.

    Notes
    -----
    * Many operations expect systems of the same residue size.
    * Designed for comparative analyses but also works with a single system.
    * The class focuses on simple, modular wrappers around common steps
      (flattening, reduction, clustering) for downstream use.

        ----------
        arrays:list, expected=list[array_1,...,array_n-1] where each array is an np.ndarray with shape=(n_frames,n_residues,n_residues)
            Each array should have the shape as described above, where each frame has an adjacency matrix of pairwise
            comparisons between all residues. The only axis that can differ between arrays is the number of frames (n_frames).

            
        Returns
        -------
        array:np.ndarray,shape=(sum(n_frames),n_residues*n_residues) where the sum of n_frames refers to the total number of frames.
            Each row of the new matrix represents a flattened adjacency matrix for each frame, and the frames are stacked
            in such a way that each of the original arrays follow each other sequentially.

        Notes
        -----
        First we concatenate all of our arrays into one large array. This does however rely on the premise that the only difference
        between our arrays is the number of frames (n_frames). This holds true conceptually because if we have a different
        number of pairwise residue comparisons we would not have comparable networks, or "systems".

        The goal is to flatten each adjacency matrix into a 1 dimensional vector and then stack all frames.
        This results in the expected formatting for scipy's kmeans clustering implementation where each .

        ----------
        systems_array:np.ndarray,shape(n_frames,n_residues,n_residues)
            An averaged array (or individual frame of a trajectory) that is to be visualized.
            Since a typical adjacency matrix is NxN observations we will not focus on the multiple
            frames of the trajectory and will assume an averaged matrix has been provided. Alternatively
            this function can take a single frame from anywhere in the trajectory if you wish to analyze it

        residues:list,shape=(res_indexes,), where res_indexes==int
            A list denoting all of the residue indexes that you would like to analyze pairwise interactions for.
            This can be two residues meaning you just want to see the pairwise interactions between them or
            more residues and then you would get *all possible pairwise combinations of theese residues interactions*
        
        mode:string,default="sum",
            A string argument that decides the aggregation metric by which you would like to aggregate every frame. Mean of
            the residues of the CAR interaction surface for example, would give you the average hydrogen bonding found between all
            the residues of the car interaction surface and the +1 codon, sum would give you the total net hydrogen bond counts.

        avg_ta_labels:array,shape=(n_frames,):
            An array of the same size as the frames of interest except it just contains an average
            of all the possible pairwise hydrogen bonding interactions of the residues of interest for
            each frame

        ----------
        This is actually a more powerful function than it may appear at first because if you only,
        say your pca found a few pairwise comparisons be incredibly important, well now we can isolate
        for just thoose frames and see which is best.

        ----------
        feature_matrix : np.ndarray,shape=(sum(n_frames),n_residues*n_residues) where the sum of n_frames refers to the total number of frames.
            Each row of the new matrix represents a flattened adjacency matrix for each frame, and the frames are stacked

        str : outfile_path, default=os.getcwd()
            path to where you would like to save your visualization
        
        method :str, order:{'PCA','UMAP'}
            Define which method you would like to use to perform dim-reduction. We provide two methods a linear
            and non-linear method, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
            (UMAP).

        min_dist : float,default=0.5
            This is a UMAP-specific parameter. It controls how tightly UMAP is allowed to pack points together. 
            Lower values will preserve more of the local clusters in the data whereas higher values will push 
            points further apart.

        n_neighbors : int,default=900
            Another UMAP-specific parameter. It determines the number of neighboring points used in 
            local approximations of the manifold. Larger values result in more global structure being preserved.
 

            

        
        Returns
        -------
        X_pca,weights,explained_variance_ratio_

        X_PCA:np.ndarray,shape=(n_samples,n_components)
            An array returned by the PCA module in scikit-learns vs.cluster module. Essentially it is the x and y coordinates
            of every sample from the original feature matrix now reduced into the principal component embedding space.
            ---As in the output from scikit learns module PCA() from the cluster.vq() module check in later for link---

            In theory it should be (n_sampels,2) since we are generally reducing to two principal components but, if you choose to 
            use a different number of principal components this would be a different # thus, the signature is broad


        weights:shape=(n_samples,n_components)
            The loadings for each principal component. Theese can be thought of as eigenvector components and they are the raw values 
            they have not been **2 for magnitude measurements yet. This is a seperate function in this module called create_PCA_ranked_weights.

        explained_variance_ratio_:int,
            The explained variance ratio of the principal components. This is just a fraction since we are using two principal components
            but, if you choose to use more it would be slightly different.

        Parameters
        ----------
        labels:listlike
            A list or array of labels that tell us which cluster each sample belongs to

        coordinates:array,shape=(n_samples,featuresures)
            An array which tells us the coordinates of each sample so we can form distributions from them and run statistical tests
            (pearson corellation coefficient)
        
        cluster_centers:listlike,shape=k
            A list of arrays which tell us the coordinates for each cluster center so that we can calculate distributions
            to them


        Returns
        -------
        correlation_df : pandas.DataFrame
            Long-form table of pairwise Pearson correlations between *equal-length* samples
            drawn from per-cluster distance distributions (truncated to the shortest length
            across clusters). Columns:
              - ``cluster_i`` (int): first cluster id
              - ``cluster_j`` (int): second cluster id
              - ``pearson_r`` (float): correlation coefficient
              - ``p_value`` (float): two-sided p-value


        Notes
        -----
        Distances are computed as Euclidean distances from each point to the center of its
        assigned cluster. Because clusters can have different sizes, distributions are
        truncated to the minimum cluster size before computing pairwise correlations to
        avoid unequal-sample artifacts.

        This is a simple exploratory comparison of cluster compactness/shape; interpret
        p-values cautiously, especially when sample sizes are small or heavily truncated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    outfile_path : str or pathlib.Path, optional
        Directory where outputs may be written. If ``None``, uses the current working directory.
    weights : np.ndarray, shape = (n_components, n_features), optional
        PCA component loadings (rows = components, columns = features). If ``None``, this
        function calls ``reduce_systems_representations()`` to compute PCA (default n=2)
        and uses the returned ``weights``.
    indexes : array-like of int, optional
        Residue indices used to label pairwise comparisons. If ``None``, uses ``self.indexes``.
        These indices define the order used to generate upper-triangle residue–residue
        comparison labels (e.g., "12-47").

    Returns
    -------
    dataframe: pandas.DataFrame,
        A table mapping each feature (upper-triangle residue pair) to its PCA weights and
        magnitudes.
        
        
        Columns include:

        
        * `Comparisons`    : str   — 'i-j' residue pair label
        * `PC1_Weights`    : float — raw loading for PC1
        * `PC2_Weights`    : float — raw loading for PC2
        * `PC1_magnitude`  : float — (PC1_Weights)**2
        * `PC2_magnitude`  : float — (PC2_Weights)**2
        * `PC1_mag_norm`   : float — min–max normalized PC1_magnitude to [0, 1] (within PC1)
        * `PC2_mag_norm`   : float — min–max normalized PC2_magnitude to [0, 1] (within PC2)

        
    Notes
    -----
    

    - Only the upper triangle (excluding the diagonal) of the residue–residue matrix is used,
    so each row corresponds to a unique residue pair.
    - “Weights” are PCA component loadings (eigenvector entries). Squaring gives a magnitude
    that is convenient for ranking feature importance within a component (sign is discarded).
    - The min–max normalization is performed **within each component** to [0, 1] and is intended
    for visualization/ranking. Do not compare these normalized values across different PCA
    runs unless you control scaling consistently.
    - This function assumes at least two components are available; it reports PC1 and PC2.
